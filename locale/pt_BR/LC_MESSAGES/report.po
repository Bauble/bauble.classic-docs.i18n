"Creating reports with Mako is similar in the way that you would create a web"
" page from a template.  It is much simpler than the XSL Formatter(see below)"
" and should be relatively easy to create template for anyone with a little "
"but of programming experience."

"The template generator will use the same file extension as the template "
"which should indicate the type of output the template with create.  For "
"example, to generate an HTML page from your template you should name the "
"template something like `report.html`.  If the template will generate a "
"comma seperated value file you should name the template `report.csv`."
