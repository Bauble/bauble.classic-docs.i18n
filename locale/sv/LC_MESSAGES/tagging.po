"of object that you want to recall later. For example if you want to collect "
"a bunch of plants that you later want to create a report from you can tag "
"them with the string \"for that report i was thinking about\". You can then "
"select \"for that report i was thinking about\" from the tags menu to show "
"you all the objects you tagged."
